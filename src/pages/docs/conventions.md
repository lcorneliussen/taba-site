title: Rename conventions
description: Every wtc name a project may still use, its taba name, what each release supports, and how to migrate.

wtc is now taba. A project still depends on names from the wtc days: harness and collection files, user directories, skill names, environment variables, and scripts that call `wtc`. This page lists each of these conventions, the taba name that replaces it, what the current release supports, and how to migrate.

## Phases of a taba project

A project moves through these stages at its own pace ([#375](https://github.com/lcorneliussen/taba/issues/375)):

| Stage | Release | What holds |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | wtc `0.1.x` | Only the wtc conventions. |
| 2 | taba `0.2.x`, with wtc conventions | Both names work. Nothing has to change. |
| 3 | taba `0.2.x`, all wtc conventions migrated | `taba doctor` reports nothing left to migrate. |
| 4 | taba `0.2.x`, with the project flag | The harness's `taba.toml` turns off wtc conventions for the project, and `taba doctor` fails while any remain (planned). |
| 5 | taba `0.3.x` | wtc conventions are detected, and taba stops with upgrade instructions instead of using them (planned). |
| 6 | taba `0.4.x` | No wtc logic is left; leftover wtc conventions are ignored (planned). |

Not every convention has a taba name yet. Those are marked "Old name only" below, and `taba doctor` reports them as *waiting* rather than asking you to migrate them.

## Check a project

> `taba doctor` reports conventions, and `taba conventions` exists, from the first 0.2.x release that includes [#375](https://github.com/lcorneliussen/taba/issues/375). Check the [release notes](https://github.com/lcorneliussen/taba/releases) before relying on them.

```sh
taba doctor            # this collection, its harness, and your user directories
taba doctor --all      # every collection in the workspace; also from the workspace root
taba conventions       # this list, from the installed release
```

`doctor` prints each convention it finds once, with its migration step, followed by the places it was found. *migrate* means you can move it now. *waiting* means taba has no new name for it yet, or taba moves it itself. During 0.2.x, findings never fail `doctor`. `--json` returns the same findings.

## Migrate in this order

1. **Upgrade the harness to the latest 0.2.x** and roll it out, so every collection's pinned CLI reads both names.
2. **Harness files:** rename `wtc.toml` and `.wtc-cli-version` together, plus any skill digests, in one harness change. Review, commit and merge it as usual, then roll it out.
3. **Harness references:** replace `WTC_*` with `TABA_*` and `wtc` with `taba` in hooks, scripts, skills and instructions.
4. **Each collection:** rename `WTC-SCOPE.md` and update `.env.collection.local`.
5. **Your machine:** rename `wtc.env` in the control root and the user directories once no wtc 0.1.x client on the machine uses them.
6. Run `taba doctor --all` again until only *waiting* items remain.

## The conventions

The tables below come from the CLI; `taba conventions` prints the list for the release you have installed. The "In 0.2.x" column says which names the current release reads:
- *Both names; the old one wins if both exist:* taba reads either name, but never combines them. Keep only one.
- *Both names; the new one wins:* environment variables. Generated files set both prefixes.
- *Old name only:* there is no taba name yet.
- *New name written:* taba already writes the new name.


### Harness

| Old | New | In 0.2.x | Written by | `doctor` | Migrate |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `wtc.toml` | `taba.toml` | Both names; the old one wins if both exist | you | yes | `git mv wtc.toml taba.toml` in the harness, then commit and merge it as usual. |
| `.wtc-cli-version` | `.taba-version` | Both names; the old one wins if both exist | you | yes | `git mv .wtc-cli-version .taba-version` in the harness, together with `taba.toml`. |
| `overlays/skills/<name>/.wtc-base.sha256` | `.taba-base.sha256` | Both names; the old one wins if both exist | you | yes | `git mv` each digest file to `.taba-base.sha256` in the same folder. |
| `skills/wtc-<name>`, `overlays/skills/wtc-<name>` | `taba-<name>` | Old name only | you | yes | Once the release names skills `taba-*` (#351), rename each folder to `taba-<name>` and update its `name:`. Until then, keep the old names. |
| `hooks/wtc/` | `hooks/taba/` (planned) | Old name only | you | yes | No new name yet (#375). Keep `hooks/wtc/`. |
| `overlays/browse/wtc-browse.lua` | `taba-browse.lua` (planned) | Old name only | you | yes | No new name yet (#375). Keep the old file name. |
| `WTC_*` variables and `wtc …` commands in harness files | `TABA_*` and `taba …` | Both names; the new one wins | you | yes | Replace `WTC_X` with `TABA_X` and `wtc` with `taba` in hooks, scripts, skills and instructions. Generated environments set both prefixes and ship both commands during 0.2.x. A few variables have no `TABA_` form yet: `WTC_GATEWAY_GIT`, `WTC_RETIRE_*`, `WTC_REVIEW_STATS_FILE`, `WTC_AGENT_ENV` and `WTC_DEV_*` (except `WTC_DEV_BUILD`). |

### Collection

| Old | New | In 0.2.x | Written by | `doctor` | Migrate |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `WTC-SCOPE.md` | `SCOPE.md` | Both names; the old one wins if both exist | you | yes | `mv WTC-SCOPE.md SCOPE.md` at the collection root. The file is local, so nothing to commit. |
| `WTC_*` in `.env.collection.local` | `TABA_*` | Both names; the new one wins | you | yes | Rename the variables in `.env.collection.local`. |
| `github:lcorneliussen/wtc-cli` in mise configuration | `github:lcorneliussen/taba` | New name written | taba | yes | Run `taba env setup` to regenerate `mise.toml`. In `taba.toml` `[mise.tools]`, rename the key by hand. |
| `.wtc/`, `.wtc-prs`, `.wtc-status.*`, `.wtc-catch-up.*`, `.wtc-reviews/`, `.wtc-review-posted/`, `.wtc-status-watchers/`, `.wtc-review-mode`, `.wtc-dev-mode.json`, `.last-wtc-status.yml` | `.taba…` spellings | Both names; the old one wins if both exist | taba | yes | Nothing to do by hand: taba still writes these names and moves them itself once writes follow the harness (#375). |
| rendered `wtc-*` skills in `.claude/skills` and `.agents/skills` | `taba-*` | Old name only | taba | no | Rendered by `taba skills render` under the old names. Renaming them to `taba-*` is planned in #351; nothing to do by hand. |

### User and control root

| Old | New | In 0.2.x | Written by | `doctor` | Migrate |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `$WTC_CONFIG_ROOT/wtc.env` | `taba.env` | Both names; the old one wins if both exist | you | yes | `mv wtc.env taba.env` in the control root. Every 0.2.x release reads it. |
| `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/wtc` | `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/taba` | Both names; the old one wins if both exist | you | yes | `mv ~/.config/wtc ~/.config/taba` (or under `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`) once no wtc 0.1.x client uses it. |
| `$XDG_DATA_HOME/wtc` | `$XDG_DATA_HOME/taba` | Both names; the old one wins if both exist | you | yes | `mv ~/.local/share/wtc ~/.local/share/taba` (or under `$XDG_DATA_HOME`) once no wtc 0.1.x client uses it. |

### Repositories

| Old | New | In 0.2.x | Written by | `doctor` | Migrate |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `x-wtc` in `.harness/dekit.tasks.yaml` | `x-taba` (planned) | Old name only | you | yes | No new name yet (#375). Keep `x-wtc`. |

### Command

| Old | New | In 0.2.x | Written by | `doctor` | Migrate |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `wtc` command | `taba` | Both names; the old one wins if both exist | taba | no | Both commands ship in 0.2.x. Call `taba` in scripts; harness files are covered by the harness-references check. |

### OpenClaw

| Old | New | In 0.2.x | Written by | `doctor` | Migrate |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| plugin id `wtc`, package `openclaw-plugin-wtc`, config `plugins.entries.wtc`, gateway state under `wtc/` | `taba` | Old name only | taba | no | Nothing to do yet; `taba doctor --openclaw` will move the gateway config when the plugin is renamed (#375). |

### Internal names

| Old | New | In 0.2.x | Written by | `doctor` | Migrate |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| git refs `refs/wtc-catch-up/…`, `wtc-pr-<n>` remotes, review markers `wtc-review v1`, locks `.wtc-runtime.lock`, `.wtc-status-watchers.lock`, `.wtc-prs.lock`, MCP and generated-file markers, temporary files | taba spellings | Old name only | taba | no | Nothing to do: taba reads and moves these itself. Locks keep their names while any supported client uses them. |
